    content: `Cold cutting and flange facing are important services for the preparation and maintenance of pipelines
and equipment in various industries such as oil and gas, power generation, and manufacturing.

1. Ensures Proper Alignment 
2. Improves Sealing:
3. Reduces Damage:
4. Saves Time and Money:
5. Ensures Compliance with Regulations

Proper preparation of pipes and flanges is essential to ensure proper alignment, sealing, and structural
integrity. Spark free pipe cutting and end preparation & beveling is achieved through use of Clamshell
type cutting machines, a very important activity in shutdown operations commencement. 

Cold cutting and flange facing prevent damage to the surrounding material and ensure that components
fit together properly, reducing the risk of leaks and other failures. We provide service involves the use of
cold cutting and flange facing tools to cut and prepare pipes and flanges for maintenance or repair.
Flange facing tools are used to machine the surfaces of flanges to ensure proper sealing and alignment.
